# 🚀 Fix Render Deployment

## ❌ Current Issue
```
Error: Cannot find module 'axios'
```

## ✅ Solution Applied
Moved `axios` from `devDependencies` to `dependencies` in `package.json`

## 🔧 Manual Steps to Fix

### 1. Commit and Push Changes
```bash
cd backend
git add package.json
git commit -m "Fix: Move axios to dependencies for Render deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Redeploy on Render
- Go to your Render dashboard
- Click "Manual Deploy" → "Deploy latest commit"
- Or wait for automatic deployment (if enabled)

### 3. Verify Deployment
Once deployed, test these endpoints:
- `GET https://your-app-name.onrender.com/api/health`
- `GET https://your-app-name.onrender.com/`

## 🎯 Expected Result
Your backend should now deploy successfully on Render!

## 📝 What Was Fixed
- `axios` is now in `dependencies` (required for production)
- `geocodingService.js` can now import `axios` in production
- All other dependencies are properly configured

**Ready to deploy! 🚀**
